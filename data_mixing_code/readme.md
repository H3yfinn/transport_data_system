# WHY
After realising that the data we were getting from most sources was not comparable to other sources data i attached this element to the datasystem so that we could use and mix different sources of data to estimate new data before selecting the best data. This way all different datasets could be used together before we filter some of them out. 
For example i found that ato and iea had evs data but ieas was for iea economys and was very detailed. Whereas the ATO data was for the ATO economys but was not as detailed. So i used the detailed IEA data to estaimte detail for the ATO data. Then since we have a complete set of data from the 8th edition model, but its accuracy is the least trustworthy of any of the data we have, we incorporated this new data into the 8th edition data so that it didnt interfere with other data in that dataset.
