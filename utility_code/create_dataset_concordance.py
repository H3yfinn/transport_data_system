#use this to create a concordance table which will establish what data we should theoretically have in all categories in the datasets, if the datasets didn't have holes in them. This will be used so that if any new datathat we werent expecting is found in the datasets, we can easily identify it and decide what to do with it. 

#This will also be useful for identifying when data might have been miscategorised, as we can expect that anything that is miscategorised will come up as a category we werent expecting to see in the concordance table.

#it will also complement the process of trying to document what data we have in the datasets

#we will create a dictionary for each data set which will 





#PROBLEM WITH THIS IS TRHAT WERE BASICALLY GONNA BE DOUBLING UP ON THE PROCESS OF BUILDING A CONCRODACNE. PERHAPS ITS BETTER JUST TO BUILD A CLEAR METHOD FOR VISUALISING WHAT IS IN THE CONCORDANCE TABLE AND THEN USE THAT TO IDENTIFY ANY PROBLEMS WITH THE DATA
#ALSO PERHAPS A CLEAR WAY OF VISUALISING WHAT IS IN THE OUTPUT FROM EACH DATASET
