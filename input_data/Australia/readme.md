A few options for AUS. The one downloaded is from the BITRE (bureau of industry transport econ resear ... ) it seems to be the best source. Although it seems like a lot of the stats have been recorded in ATO's database too (problem with this is that ADB dont ahve data split into drive type or even passenger vehicle types )

The data from ABS (aus bureau of stats) seems only available through their tableBuilder system which requires registration. There are a lot of datasets available such as:
Motor Vehicle Use, summation items
Tonnes carried
Kilometres travelled
Tonne-kilometres travelled
Fuel consumption
Value
Motor Vehicle Use, data variables
State/territory of registration
Vehicle type
Main type of journey
Year of manufacture groups
Type of fuel
Gross vehicle/combination mass groupings - for freight vehicles
Number of axles - for rigid trucks
Gross vehicle/combination mass groupings - for rigid trucks
Gross combination mass groupings - for articulated trucks
Trailer configuration - for articulated trucks
Type of bus
Use Type (comprising of 39 categories)
Motor Vehicle Use, 2018 - Number of vehicles, summation items
Number of vehicles
Value
Motor Vehicle Use, 2018 - Number of vehicles, data variables
State/territory of registration
Vehicle type
Year of manufacture groups

But I dont want to try register yet as it seems this data might be available through ITF's dataset (OECD https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/search?value1=transport&option1=quicksearch&facetOptions=51&facetNames=pub_igoId_facet&operator51=AND&option51=pub_igoId_facet&value51=%27igo%2Foecd%27&option3=dcterms_type&value3=subtype%2Fstatistical&publisherId=%2Fcontent%2Figo%2Foecd)
