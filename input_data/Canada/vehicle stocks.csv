Footnotes:
1,"For 2001, the number of trailers for Ontario was calculated using the file provided by Ontario in January, 2002"
2,"A break in the series occurs with the release of the 2010 data due to an improvement in the method used to assign vehicle type. At the national level, the main impact of this change was a net increase in the number of vehicles weighing 15 tonnes and more and a net decrease in the number of vehicles weighing from 4.5 tonnes to less than 15 tonnes. The impacts vary considerably by province and territory."
3,"For 1999 and 2000, the number of trailers in Ontario was provided by the Ontario Ministry of Transportation in the annual publication entitled "Ontario Vehicle Population Statistics"."
4,"Due to a change in British Columbia's regulations in 2015, more off-road vehicles are now registered."
